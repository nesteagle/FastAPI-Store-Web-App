## ‚ú® Key Features
- üîê Secure Auth0 user and endpoint authentication
- üí≥ Complete payment integration with webhooks
- üé® Mobile-first Tailwind CSS theming with custom @theme integration and dark mode
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Containerized Azure deployment with multi-service architecture
- üõ¢Ô∏è Complete DB integration using Azure SQL + SQLModel, with optimized queries and transaction consistency

## üìñ Project Overview

This was my summer project between first and second year at UBC Computer Science. Over 4 weeks (June 19 - July 13), I independently learned the skills from scratch, fully implemented this application, and deployed using Azure Cloud infrastructure.

## üåê Live Demo

For demonstration purposes, use these Stripe test card numbers:
```
Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
```

*Note: Each Azure container may take 30 seconds to wake up, this keeps hosting costs minimal for a demo project like this.*

## üéì Learning Journey
This project represents my deep dive into modern web development during my first-year summer break. I started learning FastAPI in mid-June, with my first commit June 19, and deployed by July 13.

**What challenged me most:** 
- I accidentally implemented JWT decoding from scratch before discovering auth0-fastapi
- Deployment to Azure and learning modern deployment pipelines
- Ensuring webhook reliability and transaction consistency between Stripe and my database after deployment
