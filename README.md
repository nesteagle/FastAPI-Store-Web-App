## üöÄ Project Overview

This production-ready e-commerce platform was a summer project of mine between first and second year, during my undergraduate degree in Computer Science + Statistics at UBC. In just a few weeks, I independently architected, developed, and deployed a production-ready application that rivals industry standards, demonstrating both technical excellence and rapid learning capabilities.

**What makes this extraordinary:**
- **Student Achievement**: Built entirely during my first-year summer break, showcasing accelerated learning and professional-level execution
- **Self-Taught Full-Stack Mastery**: Independently learned and implemented modern web technologies including React, FastAPI, Auth0 authentication and RBAC, and Stripe payments by studying official documentation, advancing from foundational programming to production-ready development in a month.
- **Cutting-Edge Technology**: Early adoption of Auth0-FastAPI (which at time of integration was 2 weeks old) and other recent technologies (e.g. Tailwind CSS v4.1, released April 2025)
- **Production Excellence**: Backend components crafted with a detail-oriented process, demonstrating industry best practices such as authentication, RESTful APIs, and payment processing
- **Complete Ownership**: Solo development of each aspect, demonstrating comprehensive full-stack knowledge beyond typical academic projects.
